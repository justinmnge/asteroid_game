# README

Welcome to **Asteroids!**, the ultimate space adventure! Strap in and take control of your spaceship as you navigate through a chaotic asteroid field. Blast as many asteroids as you can, dodge incoming debris, and see how long you can survive in this high-octane Pygame-powered remake of the classic arcade hit!

# How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal and type `python3 main.py` to start the game.
   
2. **Controls**:
   - **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate your ship.
   - **Up/Down Arrow**: Press to thrust forward and reverse to move your ship.
   - **Spacebar**: Fire your weapon to destroy incoming asteroids.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Destroy the asteroids
   - Avoid collisions with asteroids to stay alive. The game ends when your ship is destroyed.

Good luck, and enjoy your time in space!

### Future implementation:
   - <s>Add a background image</s>
   - Add a scoring system
   - Implement multiple lives and respawning
   - Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
   - Add acceleration to the player movement
   - Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
   - Create different weapon types
   - Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
   - Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
   - Add a shield power-up
   - Add a speed power-up
   - Add bombs that can be dropped
